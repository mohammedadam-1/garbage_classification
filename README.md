## Garbage Classification with EfficientNetV2B2

### Project Description

In this project, we aim to develop a sophisticated **garbage classification system** leveraging the **EfficientNetV2B2** architecture. Our primary dataset serves as a foundation for building models that can eventually automate waste segregation, a critical step in optimizing recycling and waste management, ultimately aiding in environmental conservation.

**Goal**: To develop an accurate and efficient garbage classification model using EfficientNetV2B2 and transfer learning for automated waste sorting.
