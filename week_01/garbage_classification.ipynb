    "In this project, we aim to develop a sophisticated **garbage classification system** leveraging the **EfficientNetV2B2** architecture. Our primary dataset serves as a foundation for building models that can eventually automate waste segregation, a critical step in optimizing recycling and waste management, ultimately aiding in environmental conservation.\n",

    "**Transfer Learning** is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model developed for a specific task is reused as the starting point for a model on a different but related task. It also allows us to build accurate models in a time-saving way by starting from patterns learned when solving a different problem. This approach is beneficial when there is limited data for the new task, as the pre-trained model already has learned features that can be adapted. Transfer learning can significantly improve models' performance and efficiency in domains like computer vision and natural language processing.\n",
